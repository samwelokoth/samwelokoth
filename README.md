👋 Warm greetings, I am @samwelokoth, an ardent Information Technology scholar currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree. My enthusiasm for technology knows no bounds, encompassing a wide spectrum of domains, from software development, quality assurance, and the seamless implementation of applications and websites to an unwavering commitment to fortifying digital security. Currently, I am on a profound journey, delving into the captivating realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence through an enriching academic pursuit at the prestigious TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MOMBASA(TUM).

💼 In my professional capacity, I serve as a dedicated software developer (LEARNER) at Alx, where I am vigorously engaged in expanding my skill set in the domain of full-stack development.

🌱 Beyond academic endeavors and professional commitments, I am resolutely focused on fostering collaborative opportunities. I am keen to contribute to web development projects, leveraging my expertise in Python, CSS, HTML, and PHP, to craft innovative and engaging online experiences.
In my free time, I engage in white hat hacking, for the benefit of strengthening various systems, identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities before the bad guys get hold of the vulns.
